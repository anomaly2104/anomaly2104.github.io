### Introduction
Almost every product based company has a System Design round in their interviews. So, it becomes very important to get hold of this if you are preparing for such companies.  
Most engineers struggle with the system design interview (SDI), partly because of their lack of experience in developing large-scale systems and partly because of the unstructured nature of SDIs.   
Thus, I designed this course so that you can perform well at system design interviews.

### Goals
* People should be able to design better systems during the interview.
* One of the most important goal of this course is that you should get lot of practical experience through lab sessions.

### Course Features
* Small batch size.
* Best in industry.
* Exclusive course content.
* Various case studies.
* Hands on Lab sessions using Azure/AWS.

### Tentative start date: 
First week of July 2020

### Tentative fees: 
Rs. 9999 
* For first 5 signups: 20% early bird discount.
* For next 5 signups: Free mock interview on system design.
  
(First 5 and next 5 will be decided as per the order of payments. So you will first make the payment and then if you come in first 5, then I will refund your 20% for first offer and for second offer, I will take your mock interview post completion of course.)

### Instructor profile:
I am Udit Agarwal. I am Technology Enthusiast and currently working as a Software Engineer in Backend. I have been working in the industry for quite sometime now and I have most of my experience in designing and scaling Backend Systems. Have worked with companies like Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Directi. Each company gave me an opportunity to work on various types of high throughput systems like chat applications, e-commerce, cloud file systems, streaming systems etc. With every product, I faced different challenges which taught me how to design the right systems using different technologies for the given problem. I have a sound knowledge of Java, DynamoDB, SQL, Caching technologies like Redis, Queuing systems like SQS, Kafka, etc. I graduated from IIIT Allahabad in 2013.
